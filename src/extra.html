            Ramen Empire is a full-stack food ordering web application, where
            the user can order food items from the comfort of where ever they
            are located. The user is able to check out once they ordered their
            items, and receive a text that tells them how long it will take for
            the food to be prepared. On the last page, a confirmation number
            will be provided, and a Google Map indicating the distance between
            the user and the restaurant, and the duration it'd take for pick up
            based on different transportation methods, such as walking, biking
            or driving. <br />
            <br />The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack clone
            of the famous food ordering app called Ritual. As the concept of
            ordering food online has become popular recently, my team decided
            that learning how to build this type of application would be useful
            and beneficial for our own learning as well.

            As a learning developer with 3 weeks of programming experience, this
            was the first Full-Stack web app that I built alongside with 3 other
            team members. It was all of our first times working in a group
            setting in this field, so navigating through the planning process
            was new to us. We had to complete this project in a 1 week time, so
            there was added pressure time crunch pressure. We faced many
            obstacles along the way, such as setbacks from learning new
            technologies such as Twilio, communicating with team members and Git
            merge conflicts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although the first leg of the project was challenging due to our
            inexperience, we quickly adapted, learned from our errors and
            successfully completed the project on time. Communication improved
            and help was provided to each other whenever needed.

            First introduction to Ajax and jQuery was through building this
            Twitter clone. Initially, it was a bit difficult to implement as my
            vanilla JavaScript skills were not as strong. HTML and CSS was also
            not as strong, so with 4 days to build this project, it was quite
            challenging. However, by the end of this project, I became much more
            comfortable with each concept, and jQuery became much more
            straightforward.

            KitchenHero is a Full-stack web application that allows users to
            search for both food and cocktail recipes based on the ingredients
            that they have by either typing them in the search bar, or by
            uploading a picture of their food product.

            <br /><br />This app was created during the beginning of the Covid
            pandemic, when the lock-down and social-distancing rules were
            strict, resulting in most people having to stay at home. This also
            resulted in more people cooking at home, instead of eating out.
            <br /><br />
            This app was designed for not only people that have experience
            cooking, but also individuals who are beginners. Instead of
            scavaging through countless websites for different recipes, this app
            solves this problem, and makes best use of any left over ingredients
            in the pantry.

            As a learning developer, this was the first project that was done
            completely remote with two other team mates due to Covid, which was
            quite challenging. We had 1.5 weeks to complete this project and at
            the beginning of the project, most of us were very new and
            inexperienced with React, let alone building a full-stack
            application with new technologies. However, we were able to overcome
            the challenges by finishing the project on time, and through
            consistent communication via Zoom and Slack. We planned extensively,
            and had great team chemistry.

            Ramen Empire is a full-stack food ordering web application, where
            the user can order food items from the comfort of where ever they
            are located. The user is able to check out once they ordered their
            items, and receive a text that tells them how long it will take for
            the food to be prepared. On the last page, a confirmation number
            will be provided, and a Google Map indicating the distance between
            the user and the restaurant, and the duration it'd take for pick up
            based on different transportation methods, such as walking, biking
            or driving. <br />
            <br />The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack clone
            of the famous food ordering app called Ritual. As the concept of
            ordering food online has become popular recently, my team decided
            that learning how to build this type of application would be useful
            and beneficial for our own learning as well.

            As a learning developer with 3 weeks of programming experience, this
            was the first Full-Stack web app that I built alongside with 3 other
            team members. It was all of our first times working in a group
            setting in this field, so navigating through the planning process
            was new to us. We had to complete this project in a 1 week time, so
            there was added pressure time crunch pressure. We faced many
            obstacles along the way, such as setbacks from learning new
            technologies such as Twilio, communicating with team members and Git
            merge conflicts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although the first leg of the project was challenging due to our
            inexperience, we quickly adapted, learned from our errors and
            successfully completed the project on time. Communication improved
            and help was provided to each other whenever needed.
