            The interview scheduler allows the user to book an appointment
            between Monday-Friday, select an interviewer from the available
            interviewers list. The user can also delete and modify their
            appointments. This was the first React project of the course, where
            components were built with Storybook, and tested with Jest

            First introduction to React was through building this web app, which
            was a great learning curve. Due to Covid-15, we had to create this
            project remotely, which was a challenge in itself as I was much more
            used to working on projects in person. Also, it was my introduction
            to using new technologies such as Storybook and Jest. As someone
            that was relatively new to programming, learning React while being
            remote was tough, but I was able to overcome this challenge through
            communication and collaboration with fellow classmates, and asking
            for mentor help whenever needed.
