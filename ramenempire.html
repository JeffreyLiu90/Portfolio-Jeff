            Ramen Empire is a full-stack food ordering web application, where
            the user can order food items from the comfort of where ever they
            are located. The user is able to check out once they ordered their
            items, and receive a text that tells them how long it will take for
            the food to be prepared. On the last page, a confirmation number
            will be provided, and a Google Map indicating the distance between
            the user and the restaurant, and the duration it'd take for pick up
            based on different transportation methods, such as walking, biking
            or driving. <br />
            <br />The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack clone
            of the famous food ordering app called Ritual. As the concept of
            ordering food online has become popular recently, my team decided
            that learning how to build this type of application would be useful
            and beneficial for our own learning as well.

            As a learning developer with 3 weeks of programming experience, this
            was the first Full-Stack web app that I built alongside with 3 other
            team members. It was all of our first times working in a group
            setting in this field, so navigating through the planning process
            was new to us. We had to complete this project in a 1 week time, so
            there was added pressure time crunch pressure. We faced many
            obstacles along the way, such as setbacks from learning new
            technologies such as Twilio, communicating with team members and Git
            merge conflicts.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although the first leg of the project was challenging due to our
            inexperience, we quickly adapted, learned from our errors and
            successfully completed the project on time. Communication improved
            and help was provided to each other whenever needed.
