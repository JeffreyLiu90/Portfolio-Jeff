            Project Summary
          </h2>
          <p class="info-content summary-content">
            KitchenHero is a Full-stack web application that allows users to
            search for both food and cocktail recipes based on the ingredients
            that they have by either typing them in the search bar, or by
            uploading a picture of their food product.

            <br /><br />This app was created during the beginning of the Covid
            pandemic, when the lock-down and social-distancing rules were
            strict, resulting in most people having to stay at home. This also
            resulted in more people cooking at home, instead of eating out.
            <br /><br />
            This app was designed for not only people that have experience
            cooking, but also individuals who are beginners. Instead of
            scavaging through countless websites for different recipes, this app
            solves this problem, and makes best use of any left over ingredients
            in the pantry.

            As a learning developer, this was the first project that was done
            completely remote with two other team mates due to Covid, which was
            quite challenging. We had 1.5 weeks to complete this project and at
            the beginning of the project, most of us were very new and
            inexperienced with React, let alone building a full-stack
            application with new technologies. However, we were able to overcome
            the challenges by finishing the project on time, and through
            consistent communication via Zoom and Slack. We planned extensively,
            and had great team chemistry.
