      <p>KitchenHero is a Full-stack web application that allows users to search for both food and cocktail recipes based on the ingredients that they have by either typing them in the search bar, or by uploading a picture of their food product. 
        
        <br><br>This app was created during the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when the lock-down and social-distancing rules were strict, resulting in most people having to stay at home. This also resulted in more people cooking at home, instead of eating out. <br><br> This app was designed for not only people that have experience cooking, but also individuals who are beginners. Instead of scavaging through countless websites for different recipes, this app solves this problem, and makes best use of any left over ingredients in the pantry. </p>
